# Run the Nox testing suite for comprehensive testing
nox:

# NOTE: Nox must be installed as a global tool, it can't be installed
# as a dev dependency because it manages virtual environments.
# I install nox using UV (`uv tool install nox`). It looks for the noxfile.py.

# Run the .github/scripts files and push the tags
release: sync-tags
  bash .github/scripts/release.sh && \
  git push --tags

# git push --tags does not push commits to your main branch (or any other branch). It only 
# uploads the "tag objects"—which are essentially just small pointers that say, "This 
# specific commit hash has the name v1.0."

# Because a tag is just metadata sitting "on top" of a commit that usually already exists 
# on the server, pushing a tag doesn't change the branch itself. And so the push request
# is not blocked by Github's branch protection rules even if its configured to block 
# pushes to the main branch.

# Syncs the tags from origin to local
sync-tags:
  git fetch --prune origin "+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*"
