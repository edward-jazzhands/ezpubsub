# HOW THIS WORKFLOW WORKS
# This workflow automates creating a GitHub Release and publishing the Python package to PyPI.

# --- Manual Steps ---
# 1. Edit `pyproject.toml` to set the new version (e.g., `version = "1.2.3"` or
#    `version = "1.2.4-rc1"` for pre-releases).
# 2. Commit the change and merge it to the `main` branch (From the feature branch or  
#    however you work).
# 3. On your local machine, fetch and pull the latest changes from `main` to ensure
#    you're up to date.
# 4. Run the release script, then push the tags to GitHub (conditonal on success):

#    `bash .github/scripts/release.sh && git push --tags`

# This command will:
# - Check that you're on the `main` branch and that it's up to date with `origin/main`.
# - Create a new tag based on the version in `pyproject.toml`.
# - Pushes the new tag to github which, triggers this workflow file.

# This workflow file then:
# - Checks that the tag matches the version in `pyproject.toml` on the `main` branch.
# - Builds the sdist and wheel.
# - Publishes the package to PyPI using trusted publishing.
# - Reads the release notes from your CHANGELOG.md.
# - Creates a new GitHub Release, marking it as a pre-release if necessary.
